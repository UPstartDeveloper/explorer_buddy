# Why am I Creating Explorer Buddy, and Why is it Useful?
Kids love asking questions. Taking notes is a skill they use in school to track their learning,
but what about the questions they have in everyday life?

Children can use Explorer Buddy as their space:
to ask questions,
to make observations about everyday life,
and to have the opportunity to take ownership over a subject they're truly passionate about.

Explorer Buddy makes taking notes more lightweight than having to keep track of paper notebooks.
It's a gift to the kids who don't see learning as a chore - but as a way to discover the world around them.
