# Explorer Buddy
They say we have more information available us today than ever before - but does that make us more knowledgeable?
Learning is about asking questions, not just looking up answers others have found for you.
Explorer Buddy is a note taking app for the most curious among us - children, who want a companion
to help take ownership over the questions they want answered about the world around us.
Explorer Buddy will allow users to discover knowledge through jotting down their own observations,
asking their own burning questions, and testing their own hypotheses - all while beating traditional paper notebooks with its modern web UI/UX.
Will you help develop Explorer Buddy to be the *cutting-edge* learning resource of the future?
