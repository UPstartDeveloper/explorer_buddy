**Name**: [Zain Raza](https://github.com/UPstartDeveloper)

**About Me**: I am an 18 year-old student at Make School, a new college in San Francisco that teaches innovators how to build, design, and ship products.
I was born in Pakistan, and grew up in the Northeastern United States.
I was inspired to start this project thanks my avid interest in science growing up, especially earth science that requires you to escape into the outdoors to make your observations.

**Feature**: Initial work on building the notes package, the RESTful API, and the frontend using Bootstrap 4.

**Technologies**: Django and Bootstrap 4

**Fun Fact**: When I'm not coding, I love interviewing devs and startup founders about personal development - you can follow my podcast *[In the Making](https://anchor.fm/zain-raza)* to hear some of my conversations!
